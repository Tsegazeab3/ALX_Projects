# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository is dedicated to projects in low-level programming, with a focus on the C language. The curriculum is designed to build a strong foundation in computer science principles. Topics include:

- C fundamentals (variables, if/else, loops, functions)
- Pointers, arrays, and strings
- Memory allocation (malloc, free)
- Data structures (linked lists, hash tables)
- Static and dynamic libraries
- Makefiles

Each directory represents a project from the ALX Software Engineering program.
