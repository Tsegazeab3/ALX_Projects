# ALX Higher-Level Programming

This repository contains projects focused on higher-level programming languages, primarily Python. The projects cover fundamental concepts to more advanced topics, including:

- Python basics (Hello World, variables, control flow)
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- and more.

Each directory is a separate project corresponding to the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.
